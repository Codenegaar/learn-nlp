# Introduction

This is my attempt to learn NLP using python.

# Setup and use

- First clone this project
- Then create a virtual environment using `python -m venv learn-nlp`. You can use any environment name other that `learn-nlp`.
- Switch to the virtual environment: `source ./bin/activate`
- Then install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- And finally add the environment as a Jupyter kernel: `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=learn-nlp`
- Launch Jupyter notebook, select the kernel and open any of the notebooks you want!
